React Native Chatbot using ChatGPT

Create a free Open AI account at https://platform.openai.com/
You will be given $5 worth of credits to use. Generate an API key to use within the App.js file

Using the 'text-davinci-003' or 'gpt-3.5-turbo' models will give the best value for money
It's priced at $0.002 per 1k tokens, which is pretty cheap, so shouldn't run out with personal use, however the free credits do expire after 3 months
